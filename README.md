## Description
My motivation is to promote a culture of appreciation and recognition within work groups, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging each team member's position within the hierarchy, name, and contact details for effective communication and collaboration. The driving force behind my project was to provide teams with an opportunity to acknowledge and introduce their team members to individuals who are not part of their team. My application addresses the challenge of enabling teams to gather all pertinent information for each team member by presenting a series of targeted questions for clarification. I acquired proficiency in utilizing JavaScript, node.js, and npm to generate an HTML page.

## Usage
To utilize the Team Profile Generator, follow the installation steps and execute the code in the terminal with the command "node index". The program will prompt you with a series of six questions. The initial question will inquire whether you would like to include an employee. If you choose to proceed, the following five questions will require a response. Upon completion of each set of questions, you will be asked again if you would like to add another employee. This process will continue until you indicate that there are no additional employees to add by entering "n". At this point, an HTML file will be generated in your folder, which can be accessed via your preferred browser. The webpage will display the data obtained for each employee added during the session.
